        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="about-info">
        <p>
          I am a dedicated and detail-oriented cybersecurity professional with a
          Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from Sadat Academy,
          graduating in June 2024 with a "Good" grade (GPA: 3.00). My passion
          for cybersecurity stems from a deep curiosity about how technology
          shapes our world and the challenges of protecting critical systems
          from potential threats. During my academic journey, I actively
          participated in various activities, such as organizing seminars and
          joining hackathons, which enhanced my teamwork, leadership, and
          problem-solving skills. These experiences ignited my passion for
          security operations and equipped me with a well-rounded skill set to
          tackle real-world challenges. I have gained practical experience
          through internships and training, specializing in SOC operations,
          incident response, and network security. My ability to analyze
          vulnerabilities, respond to cyber incidents, and collaborate with
          cross-functional teams has positioned me as a proactive and
          results-driven individual. Beyond my technical expertise, I am
          committed to continuous learning and staying updated on the latest
          advancements in cybersecurity. I firmly believe in the power of
          teamwork and knowledge-sharing to build a stronger and safer
          digital environment.
